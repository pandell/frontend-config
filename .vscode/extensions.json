    // 2023-12-12, milang: there are two main Kotlin extensions available as of 2023, but
    // neither "mathiasfrohlich.kotlin" nor "fwcd.kotlin" is "the perfect choice";
    // "mathiasfrohlich.kotlin" seems to be dead (last version is from February 2020)
    // and has wrong syntax highlighting for some Kotlin constructs; "fwcd.kotlin"
    // is under active development, but the language server is very buggy and slow
    // (thus it is disabled via ".vscode/settings.json") and also contains obsolete
    // custom fork of "facebook/ktfmt" with terrible presets (see comments in "[kotlin]"
    // section of ".vscode/settings.json"); in the end I decided to go with "fwcd.kotlin"
    // because it was "less bad" for the needs of TeamCity Kotlin development
